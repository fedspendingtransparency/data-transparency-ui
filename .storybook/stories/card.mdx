# Card

Cards are UI elements that display content and actions on a single topic.

A card is often a subset or summary of a larger idea. It acts as an entry point to more detailed information. This summary can contain a variety of content types, such as text, images and multimedia, or buttons and links.

export const Template = (args) => <CardContainer {...args} />;

For more description, see the USASpending Design System [Card Documentation](https://figma-gov.com/design/Kg3hJpzFI0XRXY5Irk8e57/USAS-%E2%80%93-Design-System?node-id=0-13720&t=VaRLbNN7sYCgvoio-0).

A Card is composed of a Card Container Component and any combination of three child components: Card Body, Card Button and Card Hero.  Each card must have a Card Container and Card Body at minimum. The card also includes other text elements specific to the USASpending Design System.  Please see the [Card Anatomy](https://figma-gov.com/design/Kg3hJpzFI0XRXY5Irk8e57/USAS-%E2%80%93-Design-System?node-id=0-13782&t=1H4iNeFxLWbyMEO9-4).

## Container Variants
There is a container variant for each card type: Elevated, Filled, and Outlined.  Each provides the same legibility and functionality, so the type you use depends on style alone.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Fill} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.Elevated} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.Outline} />

## Hero Variants
Heroes can be an image, background fill without an image, and a hero image with background fill.
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroWithImage} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroWithBarFill} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroFillWithImage} />

## Card Button
<Canvas of={CardStories.WithCardButton} />

## Card Container Props
<Controls of={CardStories.Default} />
