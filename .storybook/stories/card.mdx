```
Cards are UI elements that display content and actions on a single topic.

A card is often a subset or summary of a larger idea. It acts as an entry point to more detailed information. This summary can contain a variety of content types, such as text, images and multimedia, or buttons and links.

export const Template = (args) => <CardContainer {...args} />;

## Container Variants
There is a container variant for each types of card: Elevated, Filled, and Outlined.  Each provides the same legibility and functionality, so the type you use depends on style alone.
There are three possible children of the Card Container Component: The Card Body, Card Button and Card Hero.
<Canvas of={CardStories.Fill} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.Elevated} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.Outline} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.WithCardButton} />

## Hero Variants
Heroes can be an image, background fill without an image, and a hero image with background fill.
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroWithImage} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroWithBarFill} />
<Canvas of={CardStories.HeroFillWithImage} />
