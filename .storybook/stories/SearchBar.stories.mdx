## This is Designed to be a [Controlled Component](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components)
This means the component relies on its parent to pass the following props:
 - `onSearch`: A function that will pass the search term to it's parent component.
 
### Props:
 - `onSearch`: A function that will pass the search term to it's parent component.
 - `minChars`: A number that will serve as the minimum number of characters to submit a search.
 - `isDisabled`: A boolean that will decide whether to disable the input.
 - `throttleOnChange`:  A number in milliseconds that only invokes onChange at most once per every milliseconds.
 - `inputTitle`: A string that will serve as the input title.

<Canvas>
    <Story name='SearchBar'>
        <SearchBar
            setQuery={(searchTerm) => console.log(searchTerm)}
            minChars={number('minChars', 2)}
            isDisabled={boolean('isDisabled', false)}
            throttleOnChange={number('throttleOnChange', 500)}
            inputTitle={text('inputTitle', 'Search Input')} />
    </Story>
</Canvas>
