│   Storybook 7 introduced the concept of frameworks, which abstracts configuration for renderers (e.g. React, Vue), builders (e.g.      │
│   Webpack, Vite) and defaults to make integrations easier.                                                                             │

│   Your project should be updated to use Storybook's framework: @storybook/react-webpack5. We can attempt to do this for you            │
│   automatically.                                                                                                                       │

The migration successfully updated your 'stories' config to include any .mdx file instead of just .stories.mdx.

It also ran the 'mdx-to-csf' codemod to convert your MDX stories to CSF format.
This codemod is not perfect however, so you may need to manually fix any issues it couldn't handle.
